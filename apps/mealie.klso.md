# Mealie - Recipe manager

> Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager, meal planner and shopping list with a RestAPI backend and a reactive frontend built in Vue for a pleasant user experience for the whole family. Easily add recipes into your database by providing the URL and Mealie will automatically import the relevant data, or add a family recipe with the UI editor. Mealie also provides an API for interactions from 3rd party applications. ~ https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie/

This kelso app installs mealie v3.22.0 with the sqlite backend.

Mealie builds absolute links (password resets, shared recipes) from `BASE_URL`,
so it has to be told the address it answers on. `${routes.main}` is that
address: the URL kelso publishes the `main` route at, which is only knowable
once the app is staged and the route is allocated.

Upstream's compose sets `TZ`; this one does not. Kelso mounts the host's
`/etc/localtime` into every container, so mealie keeps the host's time without
being told what it is.
