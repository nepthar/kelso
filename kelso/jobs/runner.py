# `repo-add`, a github:// url. Nothing accepts a manifest or a filesystem path:
# those are the arguments that let a caller define what an app *is*, and
# defining an app means arbitrary bind mounts, which means root. Path-style
# `install`, and adding a local directory as a repo, stay CLI-only for exactly
# that reason; `job.app_target` is where the app-side refusal happens.
